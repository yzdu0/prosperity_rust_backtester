# Rust Backtester - forked to run grid search on a set of global variables

This repo is a self-contained Rust backtester for IMC Prosperity 4.

It only supports local backtesting. There is no API surface and no hosted workflow in this repo.

Everything needed for the default backtest flow now lives inside this directory. The bundled default trader is:

- `traders/latest_trader.py`

## Grid Search

1. Modify your `latest_trader.py`:
```python
def update_globals(self, updates: Dict[str, Any]):
```

2. Modify `src/main.rs`:
```rust
let sweep_parameters = vec![
        ("OSMIUM_CLIP", values![8, 10, 12, 14, 16]),
        ("SNIPE_POSITION_LIMIT", values![20, 25, 30]),
        ("WINDOW_SIZE", values![5, 10, 15, 20]),
        ("DEVIATION_MULTIPLIER", values![1, 2, 5, 8, 10]),
];
```

## Setup

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeyzsoN/prosperity_rust_backtester.git
cd prosperity_rust_backtester
```

### macOS

Install the toolchain once:

```bash
xcode-select --install
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
python3 --version
```

For normal end-user usage, install the published CLI from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install rust_backtester --locked
```

Then run it directly:

```bash
rust_backtester --help
rust_backtester
```

If `rust_backtester` is not found after install, make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is on your `PATH`.

If `rust_backtester cannot be executed after install, make sure that `~/scripts/cargo_local.sh` is executable:
```
ls -la scripts/

sed -i 's/\r$//' scripts/cargo_local.sh

chmod +x scripts/cargo_local.sh
```

For local development from this repo, either install the local CLI:

```bash
make install
```

or run the backtester directly from source:

```bash
make backtest
```

For the fastest local-source runs, prefer:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --help
```

The macOS `make` targets intentionally build through a wrapper instead of your full shell environment. By default they write Rust build artifacts to:

```bash
~/Library/Caches/rust_backtester/target
```

If you want a different target dir, override it explicitly:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/path/to/target make build-release
```

### Windows

Use WSL2. Open an Ubuntu shell inside WSL2 and run the same commands there. Native Windows shells are not the target environment for this repo.

There is no separate manual build step required for normal use:

- `make backtest` and the other `make` run targets use `cargo run`, which builds automatically on first use
- `cargo install rust_backtester --locked` installs the published release binary so you can run `rust_backtester` directly afterward
- `make install` installs the CLI once so you can run `rust_backtester` directly afterward
- `make doctor` prints local diagnostics for macOS build hangs and execution-policy issues

Right now the bundled public data is the raw IMC tutorial day data in `datasets/tutorial/`, the raw round 1 day data in `datasets/round1/`, the raw round 2 day data in `datasets/round2/`, the raw round 3 day data in `datasets/round3/`, the raw round 4 day data in `datasets/round4/`, plus a sample tutorial `submission.log` produced with the bundled basic trader. The remaining round folders are there so future round files can be placed in the correct folder instead of being mixed together.
If you place a portal `submission.log` file into a round folder, the backtester will use it. `submission.log` is also generated for persisted runs.

## CLI

The CLI is intentionally simple:

```bash
rust_backtester
```

With no arguments it will:

- auto-pick the newest Python file that looks like a trader from this repo's local `scripts/`, `traders/submissions/`, or `traders/`
- default the dataset to the latest populated round folder under `datasets/`
- run in fast mode
- print one compact row per day

That means the simplest local commands are:

```bash
make backtest
```

or:

```bash
rust_backtester
```

For the published crates.io binary, the normal flow is:

```bash
cargo install rust_backtester --locked
rust_backtester
```

To update later:

```bash
cargo install rust_backtester --locked
```

Round-specific shortcuts:

```bash
make tutorial
```

Submission and future-round shortcuts are also available once you place a `submission.log`, `submission.json`, or round data into `datasets/round1/`, `datasets/round2/`, and so on.

Useful optional variables for any `make` backtest target:

```bash
make tutorial DAY=-1
make submission ROUND=round1
make round3 TRADER=traders/latest_trader.py
make round3 TRADER=traders/all_products_trader.py
make round2 PERSIST=1
make tutorial FLAT=1
make tutorial CARRY=1
```

Supported input formats:

- normalized dataset JSON files
- IMC day data as matching `prices_*.csv` and `trades_*.csv`, with optional paired `observations_*.csv`
- portal submission logs such as `submission.log`

Day selection behavior:

- `DAY=-1` or `DAY=-2` runs only that day file inside the round
- `DAY=all` or omitting `DAY` runs the whole round bundle, including any submission file when present
- `make submission ROUND=round1` runs the submission dataset for `datasets/round1/` when a submission file is present

Explicit examples:

```bash
rust_backtester \
  --trader /path/to/trader.py \
  --dataset tutorial
```

```bash
rust_backtester \
  --trader /path/to/trader.py \
  --dataset datasets/tutorial
```

```bash
rust_backtester \
  --trader /path/to/trader.py \
  --dataset /path/to/submission.log
```

```bash
rust_backtester \
  --trader /path/to/trader.py \
  --dataset datasets/round1
```

Behavior:

- fast mode is the default
- the CLI prints one result row per day
- `--dataset` accepts either a path or a short alias
- when `--dataset` points to a directory, every supported dataset in that directory is run
- `prices_*.csv` files are paired automatically with matching `trades_*.csv` files from the same folder
- matching `observations_*.csv` files are loaded automatically when present and exposed through `state.observations.conversionObservations`
- `latest` and `tutorial` run the full bundled tutorial round bundle: day `-2`, day `-1`, and the sample tutorial submission log
- use `--day <n>` to run only the matching day dataset within the round bundle; this excludes submission files
- `metrics.json` is always written under `runs/<backtest-id>/`
- default fast runs also write `submission.log` under `runs/<backtest-id>/`
- use `--artifact-mode` to choose which extra artifacts are written
- use `--carry` or `CARRY=1` to carry positions, own trades, market trades, and trader state across non-submission day datasets in the same round
- use `--flat` or `FLAT=1` to place multi-run outputs in a single directory with dataset/day-prefixed filenames
- use `--persist` or `PERSIST=1` to write the full replay artifact set under `runs/`
- persisted multi-day or multi-file runs also write one combined bundle at `runs/<backtest-id>/`, including `combined.log` and `manifest.json`
- for multi-run visualizer uploads, use each child `RUN_DIR/submission.log`; the top-level bundle does not emit a stitched replay file
- product output defaults to every product so no product PnL is hidden in larger rounds

Published binary vs local development:

- `rust_backtester` runs the installed binary found on your `PATH`, typically `~/.cargo/bin/rust_backtester`
- `cargo run -- ...` runs the local source tree in debug mode
- `cargo run --release -- ...` runs the local source tree in release mode
- if end users report slow runs, make sure they are running the installed `rust_backtester` binary and not repeatedly using `cargo run`

Bundled dataset aliases:

- `latest`
- `tutorial`, `tut`, `tutorial-round`, `tut-round`
- `round1`, `r1`
- `round2`, `r2`
- `round3`, `r3`
- `round4`, `r4`
- `round5`, `r5`
- `round6`, `r6`
- `round7`, `r7`
- `round8`, `r8`
- `tutorial-1`, `tut-1`, `tut-d-1`
- `tutorial-2`, `tut-2`, `tut-d-2`

Product display modes:

- `--products full` default: print a separate product table with every product
- `--products summary`: print a compact product table with the top product PnL contributors and an `OTHER(+N)` rollup when needed
- `--products off`: show only the per-day total

Artifact modes:

- `--artifact-mode none`: write only `metrics.json`
- `--artifact-mode submission` default when `--persist` is not set: write `metrics.json` and `submission.log`
- `--artifact-mode diagnostic`: write `metrics.json` and `bundle.json` with the PnL series included for diagnostics
- `--artifact-mode full`: write the full persisted artifact set: `metrics.json`, `bundle.json`, `submission.log`, `activity.csv`, `pnl_by_product.csv`, `combined.log`, and `trades.csv`
- `--persist` implies `--artifact-mode full` unless you explicitly override `--artifact-mode`

Flat layout behavior:

- `--flat` only changes multi-run layouts; single-run outputs stay unchanged
- multi-run outputs are written into `runs/<backtest-id>/` with prefixed filenames such as `tutorial-day-2-submission.log` and `tutorial-day-2-metrics.json`
- when `--flat` is combined with `--persist`, the same directory also includes `combined.log` and `manifest.json`

Carry mode behavior:

- `--carry` only applies to non-submission day datasets; submission datasets remain separate runs
- with `--carry`, consecutive day datasets in the same round are merged into one connected replay ordered by `(day, timestamp)`
- positions, prior own trades, prior market trades, and trader data are carried across those merged day boundaries
- carry mode also normalizes timestamps into one continuous timeline, so the first tick of the next day starts immediately after the previous day ends
- a carried run reports `DAY=all` in the summary because it spans multiple days

Artifact mode examples:

```bash
rust_backtester \
  --trader /path/to/trader.py \
  --dataset tutorial \
  --artifact-mode none
```

```bash
rust_backtester \
  --trader /path/to/trader.py \
  --dataset tutorial \
  --artifact-mode diagnostic
```

```bash
rust_backtester \
  --trader /path/to/trader.py \
  --dataset tutorial \
  --artifact-mode full
```

### Bundled Targets

```bash
make doctor
make build
make build-release
make test
make install
make install-pip
make install-uv
make install-uv-editable
make backtest
make tutorial
```

## macOS Troubleshooting

If a local Rust build hangs on macOS, the most likely symptom is that `cargo build`, `make build-release`, or `make backtest` stalls during `build-script-build` while `syspolicyd` uses a lot of CPU.

First retry path:

```bash
make doctor
make build-release
make backtest
```

Those `make` targets already use the repo wrapper and a stable target dir outside the repo.

If it still hangs and you do not want to reboot, the non-restart remediation is:

```bash
sudo killall syspolicyd
make build-release
```

If local macOS execution policy is still unhealthy, use the isolated fallback:

```bash
make docker-build
make docker-smoke
```

This is a local macOS executable-launch issue, not a backtester logic issue.

Additional `round1` to `round8` and `round1-submission` to `round8-submission` targets are included in the `Makefile`. They become usable once those dataset folders contain JSON files.

## Isolated Verification

There is a Docker-based smoke path for isolated verification:

```bash
make docker-smoke
```

The Docker image builds the project in a clean container and runs the zero-argument backtest flow during image build.
